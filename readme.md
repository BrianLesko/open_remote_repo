# Github Opener

for mac users

Navigating in the terminal is easy. Especially with tab autocomplete for directory changes, but sometimes you want to open a directory in VS Code ```code .```or in Finder ```open .``` and both of those commands exist. 

This repository has a minimal bash script to implement the same functionality for opening a remote github page given you are in a directory with git initialized and a remote url set. 

## Setup
```
sudo nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add this line at the bottom
```
source <savedFilePath>/openRemoteGithubPage.sh
```
